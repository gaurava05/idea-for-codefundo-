### An online voting platform
We are planning to build an online voting platform which allows users to vote online securely. This will allow people who not present in their constituency (E.g., students pursuing their education in a college of some other constituency) to vote.

We are also planning to display the total percentage of votes cast at any moment on the portal. This helps to cast the real-time voting stats to the general public.
### How does it work?
The web portal will verify users using different types of IDs ( E.g. Aadhar card, PAN Card) to ensure the credibility of their vote.

The voters can choose well in advance their medium of voting- online or offline. 

An IoT sensor is going to keep track of votes cast on offline booths and going to update it with the online count. 

### Dataset used
We are going to use the following data to get the total eligible voters in a parliamentary to calculate the percentage.

### Technologies used
